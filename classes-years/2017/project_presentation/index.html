   Document a <a href=../project_development/index.html>final project</a> that integrates the range of units covered, 
      answering:
         what does it do?
         who's done what beforehand?
         what did you design?
         what materials and components were used?
         where did they come from?
         how much did they cost?
         what parts and systems were made?
         what processes were used?
         what questions were answered?
         how was it evaluated?
         what are the implications?
      Your project should incorporate 2D and 3D design,
         additive and subtractive fabrication processes,
         electronics design and production,
         microcontroller interfacing and programming,
         system integration and packaging
      Where possible, you should make rather than buy
         the parts of your project
      Projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual 
         mastery of the skills, and be independently operable 
   Present your final project, weekly assignments, and documentation
